# In this study 4 different models were applied on the dataset that is Decision Tree, Support Vector Machine, Random Forest, 
# and Logistic Regression. It has been observed that Random Forest classifier and SVM achieved the highest accuracy on predicted data set. 
# Although Decision Tree and Logistic Regression were also almost near in term of accuracy on the same split of training and test data.
